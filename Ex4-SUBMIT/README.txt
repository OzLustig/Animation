We chose to implement the splines using the classes eqution, polynom, spline and segment corallel to the material learnt in class.
Equation - represents the 4 equations representing the spline between two points. (as shown in PDF)
Polynom - represents a 4-degree function which is a polynom.
Spline - Represents a set of numberOfPoints*4 equations which after being solved using the JAMA jar represents the curve between two points of the given set of points.
Segment - represents a circular sequence of splines accordingly to the rules taught in recitation and lecture.
